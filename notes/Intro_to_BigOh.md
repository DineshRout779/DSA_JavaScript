# Introduction

- Before implementing an algorithm we should examine its time and space complexity.
- Its often a trade-off to prioritise one over other depending upon our current use-cases.

## Time Complexity

- Time complexity is a measure of running time of an algorithm to conclude if its a efficient algorithm or not.

## Space Complexity

Space complexity denotes the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.
